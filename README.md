# Solar_bulb
This project is related to sustainable energy resources, we have developed a model which is able to provide natural sun light in our homes, offices and critical places where safety is our prime concern. We have identified that now a days we need electric bulb during day time although natural sunlight is available outside. So by the help of this project we can provide natural sunlight in our homes and offices. And also this will reduce our electricity consumption. And will be an effective solution for the challenges like climate changes.
